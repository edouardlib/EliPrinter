Dévelopment of a 3D printer base on Marlin
The structure has been inspired by an OpenBuild project which could be found here:http://openbuilds.org/builds/voxel-ox-extendable-3d-printer-and-cnc-platform.2418/

The goal is the get a strong 3D printer with a wide printing area.

  All part has been bought from different online shops and could decrease the price to about 350€
